robots.txt : We weren't sure what robots we were supposed to allow/disallow,
so we disallowed all robots. 

Server header removal: Due to Apache's design decision, the only way to remove
the server header completely is to edit the source code. Therefore, we have
use the mod_security module to remove the server signature and edit the 
header to contain ' '.

Please do not reopen the bug.  WONTFIX is the proper status until the 
development community decides otherwise on the dev@httpd mailing list. 
Feel free to provide your input there.  (Personally, I've lost count of the
different ways I have patched different versions of httpd to remove the 
server header.  :(  )

Extra masking of PHP: We removed the "X-Powered-By" header by adding an 
'expose_php = off' line in the PHP.ini. This hides the version of PHP we are
running in our HTTP response.
