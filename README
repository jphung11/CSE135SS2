robots.txt : We weren't sure what robots we were supposed to allow/disallow,
so we disallowed all robots. The resulting file is in the root directory 
(/var/www/html).

Logging configuration and report: By default, Apache has logging enabled and
the logs are stored in /var/log/apache2. We took the access.log and imported
it into a log analyzer and exported the log as an .html file. The resulting
file is the bottom link on our website labeled "Link to Apache log." 

Compression configuration and summary: We enabled compression by enabling the
mod_deflate module and overriding its configuration through our .htaccess. 
For reference, here are some stats of what compression did for a few of our web
pages.

index.html - Original size: 1603 B, Compressed size: 622 B
error_403.html - Original size: 532 B, Compressed size: 305 B  

Server header removal: Due to Apache's design decision, the only way to remove
the server header completely is to edit the source code. Therefore, we have
used the mod_security module to remove the server signature and edit the 
header to contain ' '.

Please do not reopen the bug.  WONTFIX is the proper status until the 
development community decides otherwise on the dev@httpd mailing list. 
Feel free to provide your input there.  (Personally, I've lost count of the
different ways I have patched different versions of httpd to remove the 
server header.  :(  )

URL Rewriting: We enabled re-writing for .html and .php files. We did this 
by turning on mod_rewrite module and inserting RewriteCond and RewriteRule in
our .htaccess file located in the root directory. 

Extra masking of PHP: We removed the "X-Powered-By" header by adding an 
'expose_php = off' line in the PHP.ini. This hides the version of PHP we are
running in our HTTP response.
